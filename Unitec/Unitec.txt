Topics/Content  outline: 
Topics  include:  students  solving  a  realistic  business  problem  in  the  IT  area  of  their  study; 
students  work  closely  with  their  sponsoring  organisation  and  Unitec  supervisor  to 
understand  and  solve  the  problem  presented;  evidence  of  project  management  and  the 
processes  used  are  collected  during  the  project. 

  Expanded  Outcomes 

  

Outcomes 
« 

  

Expanded  Learning  Outcomes  will  be  defined  in  the  project  proposal  to  be  developed  by 
the  student  as  the  first  part  of  their  project 

  

  

Performance  Criteria 

« 

e 

e 

One  performance  criterion  for  all  projects  will  be  that  the  project  deliverables  satisfy 
the  user  requirements  as  identified,  or  as  renegotiated  in  the  course  of  the  project. 
<A  second  criterion  will  be  the  completion  of  an  analysis  of  the  project  process, 
including 
possible 
improvements  in  subsequent  projects. 
Projects  will  require  the  students  to  deal  with  a  complex  realistic  situation  that 
cannot  be  resolved  simply  by  the  application  of  tools,  techniques  and  products  with 
which  the  student  is  already  familiar.

Students  must  enhance their  depth  of  knowledge  within  the  Computing  Discipline 
area  of  capability (that  extends  their  knowledge  and  does  not just  use their existing  knowledge). 
Usually,  this  will  mean  developing  alternative solutions  to  a  problem  using  a  Computing  solution. 
When  proposing project ideas  students  must  be  mindful  that they  will  be  proposing  a  project  in  the 
domain of  Computing.  Usually this  will  be  within  one of the  pathways offered for  the  Bachelor of 
Computing  undertaking  the role of  a  Computing  professional:

Computer  Networks  &  Cloud  Computing  (network  engineer,  network  designer) 
Business  Intelligence  (database  developer,  database  designer,  business systems  analyst) 

Leaming  outcomes: 

1.  Prepare  and  present 
reed. 

a project proposal and  plan—usually in  response 

to a client  or workplace 

2.  Analyse  and  document user requirements. 

3.  Research  and  critically  evaluate  possible  new  developments  that  could impact the  project. 

4.  Select  appropriate  techniques  and  technologies  to  apply to  the  project. 

§.  Apply  the  selected  techniques  and  technologies. 

6.  Manage  the  project  professionally,  addressing  ethical  sues  and  project  risks  in  an  appropriate 
manner. 

7.  Analyse  the  project  solving  process  followed,  and  identify  possible  improvements. 

8.  Document  and  present the  project  process  and  deliverables  in  a  public  forum. 

Topics  may  include:  students  solving  a  realistic  business  problem  in the Computing  area of their 
study:  students  work  closely with their  sponsoring  organisation  and  Unitec  supervisor to  understand 

and solve the  problem  presented;  evidence 

of project  management and the  processes  used  are 

collected 
during the project. 

Notes:  Students  are  encouraged to  work  in teams  and  should  be  discouraged  from  working  alone  on 
projects.  Wherever  possible,  students  will  be  encouraged  to  undertake  learning  in the workplace.  Any 

project  must satisfy the  programme  committee  that it of sufficient complexity and significant  enough 
for  a  final  year  project.  Students  may,  elect to  produce  a  portfolio of  mini-projects  instead  of a  major 
undertaking—this  will  be  encouraged  for  students  undertaking  part-time studies and  working  full-time 
Students  must  be  mindful  of their obligations to  study  and if  employed  fulltime  should  undertake  the 
project  part-time. 

Assessment: 

Students will  be advised of all  matters  relating to  summative assessment  at  the  outset of the  course. 
Overall  course  grades will  represent a  balanced  assessment of achievement 
in relation to all stated 
leaming  outcomes.

Level  descriptors:  The  course  involves  knowledge  and  skills  that  enable  a  learner  to 
provide  design,  evaluate,  and  critically  examine  software  architectures.  Students  will 
develop  specialised  knowledge  in  the  software  architecture  discipline  through  a  complex 
collaborative  software  development  project.  Students  will  be  able  to  recognise  the 
developing  trends  in  the  discipline,  anticipate  changes,  predict  future  trends,  and  decide 
best  design  choices. 

Course  aim:  Students  will  be  able  to  develop  complex  software  applications  for  real-world 
scenarios,  following  state-of-the  art  software  architectural  practices.  The  course  has  a 
strong  technical  focus  and  will  prepare  students  for  collaborative  software  development, 
following  the  practices  of  large-scale  real-world  software  projects.

Lecturers  support  students  in  developing  team  skills  and  their  project  plans to  support the 
development of the  project—specific  emphasis  is  given to the  idea  of  pre-planning  and  attempting  to 
get  gameplay  features  into  the  prototype  as  quickly  as  possible.  Students  are  advised to  use  place-

for the  students to  consider  is  the  redevelopment 

of their  existing  sprite  games  created 

Student teams  are expected to  present  progress  updates of their  game  project  each week.  Students

present  these findings to  the  class  so they  can  increase  their  knowledge  and  understanding  of game

Some  Philosophical  Positions: 
Lecturers  should:

for maximum  learning—including 

©  Play the role of  guardian  and searcher of knowledge to teach  students how to find  useful

©  Ensure that the  students  usually  create  (in the first instance)  a  feature  complete prototype 

that could  mean that  the game still has  placeholder  assets.

As students  will  be working  in  teams,  lecturers  should  co-construct  project  plans with  the 
teams for more  effective  execution—attempting to  give  students  tips  and  ticks  to  make  the 
development  faster. 

Lecturers  should  advice  students of the  possibility

overcome  these  kinds of  difficulties  and  encourage effective  risk  management

architecture  and  how  to  leverage  various  cloud  technologies.  These  case  studies 
allow the  students  to  investigate  the  mechanisms  needed  to  harness  cloud 
computing  in  their  own  respective  endeavors. 

Finally,  the  course  details  many  open  research  problems  and  opportunities  that  have 
arisen from  the  rapid  uptake  of  cloud  computing. 

The  course  also  provides  hands  on  practice  throughout  the  laboratory  sessions for
