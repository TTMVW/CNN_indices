Students are required to attend 100% of all scheduled classes.  Outcome Statement: To provide students with the opportunity to research, select, integrate, and apply a range of techniques and technology in the solution of a complete realistic problem. Wherever possible students should undertake a project on behalf of a client or situated in an industrial or business environment.   Course requirements:  Each project proposal will be considered by a sub-committee of the Programme Committee, and will only be approved if the student has completed courses that are considered to be an appropriate preparation for the specific project (for example three related level 7 courses). Students must enhance their depth of knowledge within the Computing Discipline and within their area of capability (that extends their knowledge and does not just use their existing knowledge). Usually, this will mean developing alternative solutions to a problem using a Computing solution. When proposing project ideas students must be mindful that they will be proposing a project in the domain of Computing. Usually this will be within one of the pathways offered for the Bachelor of Computing undertaking the role of a Computing professional:  • Software Engineering (programmer, architect, designer) • Game Development (programmer, designer, developer) • Cyber Security (malware analyst, network security engineer) • Computer Networks & Cloud Computing (network engineer, network designer) • Business Intelligence (database developer, database designer, business systems analyst)  Learning Outcomes:  1. Prepare and present a project proposal and plan—usually in response to a client or      workplace need.  2. Analyse and document user requirements.  3. Research and critically evaluate possible new developments that could impact the         project. 4. Select appropriate techniques and technologies to apply to the project. 5. Apply the selected techniques and technologies. 6. Manage the project professionally, addressing ethical issues and project risks in an      appropriate manner.  7. Analyse the project solving process followed, and identify possible improvements. 8. Document and present the project process and deliverables in a public forum.   Learning and Teaching:  • Students progressively enhance their presentation skills throughout this course.  • Topics may be taught in an integrated manner • Supervisor/student meetings/discussions • Collaborative and/or individual projects Students provide regular progress presentations (weekly for fulltime and fortnightly for part-time). Students are expected to actively participate in all discussions related to presentations by all students undertaking the projects.  Students will participate in workshops may include, for example: stress management; risk management; client-management; ethical, moral and legal obligations as a practitioner; presentation skills; communication skills; written communication for Computing professionals; research and investigation techniques; managing teams; teamwork; project management and control; roles and responsibilities; and negotiation tactics.   Topics: students solving a realistic business problem in the Computing area of their study; students work closely with their sponsoring organisation and Unitec supervisor to understand and solve the problem presented; evidence of project management and the processes used are collected during the project.   Notes: Students are encouraged to work in teams and should be discouraged from working alone on projects. Wherever possible, students will be encouraged to undertake learning in the workplace. Any project must satisfy the programme committee that it of sufficient complexity and significant enough for a final year project. Students may, elect to produce a portfolio of mini-projects instead of a major undertaking—this will be encouraged for students undertaking part-time studies and working full-time. Students must be mindful of their obligations to study and if employed fulltime should undertake the project part-time.   Assessment: Students will be advised of all matters relating to summative assessment at the outset of the course.

Outcome Statement: To provide students with the ability to investigate and use advanced programming techniques to solve complex game development problems.  Learning Outcomes:  1. Utilise, review, and enhance graphical and animation techniques to support game       projects. 2. Utilise, review, and enhance physics and mathematical techniques to support game      projects. 3. Document, create, and test a video game prototype or proof of concept. 4. Document a post-mortem of findings regarding the rapid prototype.   Learning and Teaching:  The lecturer must consider the capabilities of the students entering the course to ensure they understand some key concepts before embarking on more complex tasks (for instance the students’ capability in undertaking more complex elements, should we recommend a 2D Rapid Game Prototype as the project and merely introduce 3D concepts rather than expect their use in the game).  Lecturers support students in developing team skills and their project plans to support the development of the project—specific emphasis is given to the idea of pre-planning and attempting to get gameplay features into the prototype as quickly as possible. Students are advised to use place-holder assets or prebuilt assets that are easily plugged into the game engine.  Only if time permitting should the students attempt to create a Beta Game—that is one that is game complete; smaller games better afford the ability to create a Beta Game in the timeframe allowed for this course.  Lecturers will stop students aiming for a Gold game (unless this is achievable)—that is feature complete, game complete, and polished game ready for publication. Perhaps, there is a possibility to aim for that goal if they work with game artists from another department or if the students themselves with to carry on with the project after the completion of this course. However, interacting with 3rd parties is time consuming and the programmers will have to provide adequate instructions for artists to create assets (for example sprite sheet sizes, sprite sizes, object sizes, object composition, etc.) One prospect for the students to consider is the redevelopment of their existing sprite games created in the prerequisite course (ISCG6442—Game Programming) and take it to a further level of polish, the Beta release would essentially become a gold release.  Student teams are expected to present progress updates of their game project each week. Students will present success stories for the other teams to utilize their wisdom. Students also present issues that have arisen during the following week for lecturer and class feedback to attempt to solve complex issues as a collective.  Individual Students will be able to construct their own specialist knowledge of game development concepts by undertaking individual tasks within the group context, some students may concentrate more on graphical programming, engine programming, mathematical or physics programming, or game-play programming. The students and lecture discuss each week the individual tasks that each team member works on, this is documented.  Students document their individual learning in their self-reflective journal; this will include difficulties that they overcame, problems solved, problems encountered, etc. Students are encouraged to present these findings to the class so they can increase their knowledge and understanding of game prototyping. Finally, students collate these findings into a reflective post-mortem.  Some Philosophical Positions: Lecturers should: • Relate any contextual industry thoughts when appropriate for maximum learning—including relating the student work to the game design concepts employed; • Play the role of guardian and searcher of knowledge to teach students how to find useful information;  • Ensure that the students usually create (in the first instance) a feature complete prototype that could mean that the game still has placeholder assets.  • As students will be working in teams, lecturers should co-construct project plans with the teams for more effective execution—attempting to give students tips and tricks to make the development faster.  • Lecturers should advice students of the possibility of tense situations often encountered during team work, however, lecturers should encourage students to be open and honest to overcome these kinds of difficulties and encourage effective risk management.  The lecturer acts as a role of co-constructor to assist the students in the production of their game prototypes—ensuring that class activities build to rapid prototypes quickly.  Lectures, laboratory work, self-directed study Notes: Students are encouraged to work in teams and should be discouraged from working alone on projects.
