students work closely with their sponsoring organisation and Unitec supervisor to understand 
and solve the problem presented; evidence of project management and the processes used are 
collected during the project. 

 

 

Performance Criteria 

•  One performance criterion for all projects will be that the project deliverables satisfy the user 

requirements as identified, or as renegotiated in the course of the project. 

•  A second criterion  will  be  the completion of an analysis of the project process, including 
an evaluation of methods used and suggestions for possible improvements in subsequent 
projects. 

Projects  will  require  the  students  to  deal  with  a  complex  realistic  situation  that cannot be resolved 
simply by the application of tools, techniques and products with which the student is already familiar.

Students are expected to adhere to Unitec’s policy on conduct in respect of staff, fellow students, and in the use of 
resources and facilities. Students are required to attend 100% of all scheduled classes. 

 

Outcome Statement: 
To provide students with the opportunity to research, select, integrate, and apply a range of techniques 
and technology in the solution of a complete realistic problem. Wherever possible students should 
undertake a project on behalf of a client or situated in an industrial or business environment.  
 
Course requirements:  
Each project proposal will be considered by a sub-committee of the Programme Committee, and will only 
be approved if the student has completed courses that are considered to be an appropriate preparation 
for the specific project (for example three related level 7 courses). 
Students must enhance their depth of knowledge within the Computing Discipline and within their area of 
capability (that extends their knowledge and does not just use their existing knowledge). Usually, this will 
mean developing alternative solutions to a problem using a Computing solution. When proposing project 
ideas students must be mindful that they will be proposing a project in the domain of Computing. Usually 
this will be within one of the pathways offered for the Bachelor of Computing undertaking the role of a 
Computing professional:  

•  Software Engineering (programmer, architect, designer) 
•  Game Development (programmer, designer, developer) 
•  Cyber Security (malware analyst, network security engineer) 
•  Computer Networks & Cloud Computing (network engineer, network designer) 
•  Business Intelligence (database developer, database designer, business systems analyst) 

 

Learning Outcomes:  
1. Prepare and present a project proposal and plan—usually in response to a client or  
    workplace need.  
2. Analyse and document user requirements.  
3. Research and critically evaluate possible new developments that could impact the     
    project. 
4. Select appropriate techniques and technologies to apply to the project. 

5. Apply the selected techniques and technologies. 
6. Manage the project professionally, addressing ethical issues and project risks in an  
    appropriate manner.  
7. Analyse the project solving process followed, and identify possible improvements. 
8. Document and present the project process and deliverables in a public forum.  

 
Learning and Teaching:  

•  Students progressively enhance their presentation skills throughout this course.  

•  Topics may be taught in an integrated manner 

•  Supervisor/student meetings/discussions 

•  Collaborative and/or individual projects 

Students provide regular progress presentations (weekly for fulltime and fortnightly for part-time). 
Students are expected to actively participate in all discussions related to presentations by all students 
undertaking the projects.  
Students will participate in workshops may include, for example: stress management; risk management; 
client-management; ethical, moral and legal obligations as a practitioner; presentation skills; 
communication skills; written communication for Computing professionals; research and investigation 
techniques; managing teams; teamwork; project management and control; roles and responsibilities; and 
negotiation tactics.  
 
Topics: 
students solving a realistic business problem in the Computing area of their study; students work closely 
with their sponsoring organisation and Unitec supervisor to understand and solve the problem presented; 
evidence of project management and the processes used are collected during the project.  
 
Notes: Students are encouraged to work in teams and should be discouraged from working alone on 
projects. Wherever possible, students will be encouraged to undertake learning in the workplace. Any 
project must satisfy the programme committee that it of sufficient complexity and significant enough for a 
final year project. Students may, elect to produce a portfolio of mini-projects instead of a major 
undertaking—this will be encouraged for students undertaking part-time studies and working full-time. 
Students must be mindful of their obligations to study and if employed fulltime should undertake the 
project part-time.  
 

Assessment: 
Students will be advised of all matters relating to summative assessment at the outset of the 
course. Overall course grades will represent a balanced assessment of achievement in relation 
to all stated learning outcomes.

Students are expected to adhere to Unitec’s policy on conduct in respect of staff, fellow students, and in 
the use of resources and facilities.   
 

Outcome Statement: 
To provide students with the ability to investigate and use advanced programming techniques to solve 
complex game development problems. 
 

Learning Outcomes:  
1. Utilise, review, and enhance graphical and animation techniques to support game   
    projects. 
2. Utilise, review, and enhance physics and mathematical techniques to support game  
    projects. 
3. Document, create, and test a video game prototype or proof of concept. 
4. Document a post-mortem of findings regarding the rapid prototype.  

 

Learning and Teaching:  
The lecturer must consider the capabilities of the students entering the course to ensure they understand 
some key concepts before embarking on more complex tasks (for instance the students’ capability in 
undertaking more complex elements, should we recommend a 2D Rapid Game Prototype as the project 
and merely introduce 3D concepts rather than expect their use in the game).  
Lecturers support students in developing team skills and their project plans to support the development of 
the project—specific emphasis is given to the idea of pre-planning and attempting to get gameplay 
features into the prototype as quickly as possible. Students are advised to use place-holder assets or 
prebuilt assets that are easily plugged into the game engine.  
Only if time permitting should the students attempt to create a Beta Game—that is one that is game 
complete; smaller games better afford the ability to create a Beta Game in the timeframe allowed for this 
course.  
Lecturers will stop students aiming for a Gold game (unless this is achievable)—that is feature complete, 
game complete, and polished game ready for publication. Perhaps, there is a possibility to aim for that 
goal if they work with game artists from another department or if the students themselves with to carry on 
with the project after the completion of this course. However, interacting with 3rd parties is time consuming 
and the programmers will have to provide adequate instructions for artists to create assets (for example 
sprite sheet sizes, sprite sizes, object sizes, object composition, etc.) One prospect for the students to 
consider is the redevelopment of their existing sprite games created in the prerequisite course 
(ISCG6442—Game Programming) and take it to a further level of polish, the Beta release would 
essentially become a gold release.  

Student teams are expected to present progress updates of their game project each week. Students will 
present success stories for the other teams to utilize their wisdom. Students also present issues that have 
arisen during the following week for lecturer and class feedback to attempt to solve complex issues as a 
collective.  
Individual Students will be able to construct their own specialist knowledge of game development 
concepts by undertaking individual tasks within the group context, some students may concentrate more 
on graphical programming, engine programming, mathematical or physics programming, or game-play 
programming. The students and lecture discuss each week the individual tasks that each team member 
works on, this is documented.  
Students document their individual learning in their self-reflective journal; this will include difficulties that 
they overcame, problems solved, problems encountered, etc. Students are encouraged to present these 
findings to the class so they can increase their knowledge and understanding of game prototyping. 
Finally, students collate these findings into a reflective post-mortem.  
Some Philosophical Positions: 
Lecturers should: 

•  Relate any contextual industry thoughts when appropriate for maximum learning—including 

relating the student work to the game design concepts employed; 

•  Play the role of guardian and searcher of knowledge to teach students how to find useful 

information;  

•  Ensure that the students usually create (in the first instance) a feature complete prototype that 

could mean that the game still has placeholder assets.  

•  As students will be working in teams, lecturers should co-construct project plans with the teams 

for more effective execution—attempting to give students tips and tricks to make the 
development faster.  

•  Lecturers should advice students of the possibility of tense situations often encountered during 
team work, however, lecturers should encourage students to be open and honest to overcome 
these kinds of difficulties and encourage effective risk management.  

The lecturer acts as a role of co-constructor to assist the students in the production of their game 
prototypes—ensuring that class activities build to rapid prototypes quickly.  
Lectures, laboratory work, self-directed study 
Notes: Students are encouraged to work in teams and should be discouraged from working alone on 
projects.
