Up to 15 credits of these may normally be used.  Any course that is recognised as contributing to a degree may be used for these credits.  The contribution to a learner’s credit count will be calculated on the basis of EFTS contribution of the external paper (ie 0..125 EFTS = 15 credits). There will be no fee charged for this paper.  Learning Outcomes The outcomes for the “unspecified credit” are not described here, as they are, by definition, external.  To be eligible for this paper, the learning outcome of the external papers taken must not significantly overlap with other papers undertaken by that learner.
